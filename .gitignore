# === Generic ===
# Logs and temporary files
*.log
*.tmp
*.temp
*.swp
*~
*.bak

# JVM crash logs
hs_err_pid*
replay_pid*

# === Build Artifacts ===
# Global build directory (covers all modules like composeApp, shared, etc.)
**/build/

# Kotlin build artifacts
*.klib

# Generated Java/Android files
*.class
# bin/ # Generally covered by **/build/
# gen/ # Generally covered by **/build/
# out/ # Generally covered by **/build/

# Android Packages
*.apk

# Java Archives (often intermediate build artifacts)
*.jar
# Keep *.war, *.ear, *.nar if you specifically use them, otherwise remove for clarity.

# *.nar

# === Gradle ===
# Ignore Gradle cache and generated files directory
/.gradle/

# Ignore Gradle user home (used by wrapper if not installed globally)
# /gradle/ # Uncomment if you have a local gradle distribution folder you want ignored

# IMPORTANT: Allow committing the Gradle wrapper files
!gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
# !gradlew
# !gradlew.bat
# Note: gradlew scripts might be ignored by OS rules below if they lack execute permission bit initially.

# Ignore local properties file (SDK paths, sensitive data)
local.properties

# === IDE Files ===
# IntelliJ / Android Studio
# Ignore the whole .idea folder (simplest approach, recommended unless sharing settings)
/.idea/

# --- OR ---
# More nuanced approach: Ignore user-specific files but keep project settings
# Uncomment the following lines and comment out '/.idea/' above if you share settings
# /./idea/modules.xml # Ignore if generated, keep if manually managed
# /./idea/workspace.xml
# /./idea/tasks.xml
# /./idea/dictionaries/ # User dictionaries
# /./idea/shelf/ # Shelved changes
# /./idea/vcs.xml # Often user-specific VCS mappings
# /./idea/libraries/ # Usually generated by Gradle sync
# *.iws # Older IntelliJ format
# *.iml # Module files, often generated by Gradle. Commit if you customize them heavily.
